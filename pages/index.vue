      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        I am a Software Engineer living in Oregon. I am a self-taught programmer who firmly believes that you can accomplish anything in this life if you put your mind to it,
        roll up your sleeves and are willing to put in the work.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        I have been writing software for over 10+ years now and I use my knowledge, passion, and influence to help my 
        clients achieve their goals.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        In my personal life I am a husband and a father of three. I enjoy all kinds of tech including 3D printing, RC anything (planes, drones, etc.), Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and use these to experiment with automation and making tech fun for everyone.
